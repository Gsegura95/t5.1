        answer: 2,
        explanation: "Probable cause uses an objective standard—what a reasonable and prudent person would believe—not proof beyond a reasonable doubt."
      },

        choices: [

        ],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Plain feel requires that the incriminating nature be immediately apparent during the lawful frisk; plain smell alone is not enough."
